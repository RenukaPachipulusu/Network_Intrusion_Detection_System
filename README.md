# Network_Intrusion_Detection_System
The Project about finding the malicious traffic on a network. In this project we tried to improved the efficiency using Machine Learning Algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network.
With the help of NSL KDD Dataset, we train the model and check the accuracy.
